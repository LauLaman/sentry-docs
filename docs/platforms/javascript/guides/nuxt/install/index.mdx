Nuxt uses ES Modules for server-side builds, which requires Sentry to register Node [customization hooks](https://nodejs.org/api/module.html#customization-hooks).
Those customization hooks need to be registered before the rest of the application.

To be able to run Sentry before the rest of the application and fully monitor the server-side, Sentry can be initialized using one of those two approaches:

- Dynamically import server code after initializing Sentry (default)
- Preload Sentry configuration with the Node `--import` CLI flag
